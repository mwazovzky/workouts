## Key Patterns

**Service + Interface DI** — Business logic in service classes (`WorkoutService`), each behind an interface, bound in `AppServiceProvider`.

**Query Builder** — `WorkoutBuilder` extends Eloquent Builder with composable scopes: `ownedBy()`, `withTemplate()`, `withActivitiesCount()`, `latestUpdated()`.

**Polymorphic Activities** — `Activity` morphs to `WorkoutTemplate` or `Workout`. Morph map in `AppServiceProvider`: `workout_template`, `workout`, `exercise`, `category`, `equipment`, `program`.

**Eloquent Resources** — All Inertia responses go through API Resources (`ProgramResource`, `WorkoutResource`, `ActivityResource`, `SetResource`, `WorkoutTemplateResource`, `UserResource`).

**Form Requests** — Validation via dedicated request classes. Authorization via policies separately.

**Role-Based Authorization** — `User::hasRole()` / `User::isAdmin()` check the `roles` relation. The `admin` middleware alias (`EnsureUserIsAdmin`, registered in `bootstrap/app.php`) gates admin web and API route groups; per-model policies (`EquipmentPolicy`, `CategoryPolicy`, `ExercisePolicy`, `WorkoutTemplatePolicy`, `ProgramPolicy`) provide defense-in-depth. `UserResource` exposes `is_admin`, so the shared `auth.user` prop drives admin-only navigation. Admin write endpoints live under `App\Http\Controllers\Api\Admin` with business logic in `App\Services\Admin` (`WorkoutTemplateService` syncs a template's nested activities and sets; `ProgramService` syncs a program's weekday template assignments — both transactionally).

**Deferred Props** — `ProgramShow` defers `workouts` (templates list); `WorkoutShow` defers `activities` (with sets, exercise, equipment, categories).

**Shared Auth** — `auth.user` shared to all pages via `HandleInertiaRequests` + `AppServiceProvider`.

**Internationalization** — `SetLocale` middleware sets locale from `User.locale`. `HasTranslations` trait on system models provides polymorphic translations with auto-eager-loading. Translations are purged only on a real/force delete, so a **soft-deleted** record still resolves its name. UI strings in `lang/*.json` are shared through Inertia and consumed via `useTranslation`.

**Soft-deleted exercises** — `Exercise` uses `SoftDeletes`: an admin "delete" **retires** it (removed from catalog/pickers via the global scope) without touching workout history. `Activity::exercise()` is `->withTrashed()`, so historical workouts and templates still resolve a retired exercise's name/effort/difficulty. Reference guards that must see retired rows use `withTrashed()` (e.g. the equipment-in-use delete guard). Templates and programs are hard-deleted (a `Workout` copies its own `name` and owns its activities/sets, so no history is lost); a template can't be deleted while a program uses it (409).

**Two-Axis Measurement** — Sets use `effort_value` (reps/seconds) + `difficulty_value` (nullable). `Equipment.difficulty_unit` (kilograms, pounds, plates, heart_rate_zone, none) controls the load axis; `Exercise.effort_type` (repetitions, duration) controls work. "Bodyweight" equipment (`difficulty_unit = none`) hides the difficulty field. For `heart_rate_zone`, `difficulty_value` is an integer 1–5 (a heart-rate zone) — validated on save by `App\Rules\HeartRateZoneWithinRange` and entered via a 1–5 picker in the set editor; a blank zone stores null. All unit/effort combinations are valid.

## Key Decisions

**Programs and workouts are separate concepts** — Programs and templates are shared catalog data. User workouts are personal copies that can diverge from the original template.

**Bulk workout save** — Workout editing happens client-side and is persisted as a full activities-and-sets payload. The service diffs, validates ownership, and applies changes transactionally.

**Repeat breaks template linkage** — Repeated workouts set `workout_template_id` to `null` so the repeated workout is treated as a user-owned copy, not a live projection of the original template.

**Translation strategy is backend-first** — System content is translated in the database, UI strings are translated from JSON files, and the frontend receives translated values rather than owning a separate i18n data source.

## Internationalization

### Locale Resolution

- Supported locales: `en`, `ru`
- User preference is stored in `users.locale`
- `SetLocale` middleware applies the authenticated user's locale
- `HandleInertiaRequests` shares `locale`, `availableLocales`, and JSON translations with every page

### Translation Sources

- System models use the polymorphic `translations` table
- `HasTranslations::createWithTranslations()` seeds records; `updateTranslations()` applies admin edits and removes blank values so reads fall back to English
- UI strings live in `lang/en.json` and `lang/ru.json`
- Validation and auth messages use Laravel language files under `lang/{locale}`

### Model Translation Rules

- `Exercise`, `Category`, `Equipment`, `Program`, and `WorkoutTemplate` are translated through `HasTranslations`
- User content is not re-translated after creation
- Workouts copy the translated template name at creation time
