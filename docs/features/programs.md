# Programs

Browse workout programs, inspect their templates, and enroll.

## Current Behavior

1. User opens **ProgramIndex** and sees all programs with enrollment state for the current user.
2. User opens **ProgramShow** and sees the selected program plus its workout templates grouped by weekday.
3. User clicks **Enroll** and is enrolled without leaving the page.
4. User opens **WorkoutTemplateShow** to inspect a single template with its activities and sets.

## Business Rules

- Programs are global catalog data. All authenticated and verified users see the same list.
- Enrollment is idempotent. Repeating the enroll action has no effect because the relation is synced without duplicates.
- Program responses expose `is_enrolled` per user rather than the full enrolled-users list.
- Templates are attached to programs through a many-to-many relation with a `weekday` pivot attribute.
- Templates, template activities, and template sets are read-only for end users.
- Users can start workouts from templates regardless of enrollment status. Enrollment currently affects only the visible state in the program UI.

## Known Limitations

- No unenroll action.
- No search, filter, or sort on the program list.
- No pagination for programs.
- No program categories, media, or difficulty metadata.
- No dashboard summary for enrolled programs or next suggested workout.
- No user-facing CRUD for programs or templates (admins manage them via [Admin Content Management](admin-content-management.md)).

## Surface Area
