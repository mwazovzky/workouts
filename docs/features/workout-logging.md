# Workout Logging

Start workouts from templates, edit activities and sets, save progress, complete, repeat, and delete workouts.

## Current Behavior

1. User starts a workout from a template, which clones template activities and sets into a new `in_progress` workout.
2. User lands on **WorkoutEdit** and manages the full workout client-side before saving.
3. User can update effort and difficulty values, toggle set completion, remove sets, remove activities, and reorder activities.
4. User can add an activity by picking an exercise from a searchable catalog. It is appended to the end of the list with one blank set, and can be reordered like any other activity.
5. Save sends the full activities-and-sets payload in one bulk request.
6. Complete marks the workout as `completed` and redirects to **WorkoutShow**.
7. **WorkoutIndex** shows the user's workout history, and **WorkoutShow** loads activities lazily.
8. User can repeat a completed workout, which creates a fresh `in_progress` copy.
9. User can delete a workout, which removes its activities and sets in the same transaction.

## Business Rules

- Workout creation requires a valid `workout_template_id`.
- New workouts are always created in `in_progress` status.
- Repeated workouts do not keep a template reference. They set `workout_template_id` to `null`.
- Workout status is one-way: `in_progress` to `completed`.
- Reads are owner-scoped through the workout query builder. Non-owners receive 404 responses.
- Mutations are policy-guarded and require the current user to own the workout.
- Save is only allowed for `in_progress` workouts.
- Complete requires `in_progress` status.
- Repeat requires `completed` status.
- Save receives the full activities-and-sets payload and diffs it against persisted records.
- Activities omitted from the payload are deleted.
- Sets omitted from an activity payload are deleted.
- Activity IDs must belong to the target workout.
- Set IDs must belong to the target activity.
- Activities added during editing have no ID and are created on save. They belong to the workout copy only and never modify the source template.
- Only active exercises are offered in the picker. Retired (soft-deleted) exercises are excluded so they cannot be added to new activities, while existing activities still resolve them.
- Frontend normalizes activity and set order before sending the payload.
- The save response returns persisted IDs, so a subsequent save updates the same rows instead of recreating them.
- A workout must retain at least one activity, and each activity must retain at least one set.
- Completed sets must have `effort_value > 0`.
- Start, repeat, save, and delete operations run in database transactions.
- Workout name is copied from the source template or source workout.

## Known Limitations

- No manual workout creation without a template.
- No reopen flow after completion.
- No rename, notes, comments, or duration tracking.
- No exercise substitution. An existing activity's exercise cannot be changed; it must be removed and re-added.
- No creating custom exercises. Added activities can only use exercises from the shared catalog.
- No sorting or filtering on workout history beyond newest updated first.
- No workout analytics such as volume, PRs, or summaries.
- No undo after deleting activities once changes are saved.
